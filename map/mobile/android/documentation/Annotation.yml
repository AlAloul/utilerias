name: Modules.Map.Annotation
summary: Represents a labeled point of interest on the map that the user can click on.
description: |
    The `Annotation` object gives you low-level control over annotations that can be added to 
    [map view](Modules.Map.View). An annotation must have its `latitude` and `longitude`
    properties set to appear on a map.


    An annotation has two states: selected and deselected. A deselected annotation
    is marked by a pin image. When the user selects the pin, the full annotation is 
    displayed.

    You can specify a custom image for the map pin by setting the
    [image](Modules.Map.Annotation.image) property. 

    When the user clicks on an annotation, a `click` event is generated. 
    
    The annotation itself does not generate these events. You must add event listeners to the map view instead 

    Use the <Modules.Map.createAnnotation> method to create an annotation.

        Fired when the user selects, deselects, or clicks on this annotation.
    description: |
        This event is not currently supported on Android. Register for the 
        [click](Modules.Map.View.click) event on the map view to receive
        events when any of the map's annotations are clicked.

        This event is fired in two circumstances:

        - If the user clicks on an annotation.
        - The user deselects an annotation.

        User deselects an annotation by clicking in the map view outside of
        the annotation. 
        The `click` event includes a value, `clicksource`, which describes the part of the 
        annotation that was clicked. Note that the possible values for `clicksource` differ between
        platforms.

      - name: title
